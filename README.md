# Social media project with sentiment analyses in python

In this project, I conducted sentiment analyses and analyzed comments for their religious connotations from the social media site Reddit. Presented is a graph of some initial results showing a disparity in how well a comment does between "Christian" and "Jewish" comments. 

Also presented is a graph showing comment score based on religious affiliation.
